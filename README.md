The Release commit is the final version of this project.

Feel free to download all source files and tinker with them.

In order to launch the game, make a separate folder with the Executable file and all dll files included.

If you have any question regarding the project and/or you're having troubles with launching the game, feel free to contact me on my Discord provided on my profile README file.

Enjoy!
